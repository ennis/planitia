     It was a nasty use-after-free due to slice::from_raw_parts ignoring lifetimes

 ✔ Replace uses of `Device::global().function` by global functions. @done (25-11-01 10:37)
 ☐ Load mesh
 ✔ Import shader-bridge @done (25-10-06 22:26)
 ✔ move to a separate repo @done (25-10-06 22:26)
 ☐ get rid of winit
 ☐ get rid of arboard
 ☐ get rid of egui
 ☐ object picking
 ☐ arbitrary data containers based on archive format
 ☐ Mesh file format
 ☐ Move assets, painting, platform etc. to another crate for potential reuse
 ☐ async asset reloading
 ☐ move egui shaders to shader-archive
 ☐ Deprecate shader-bridge? Move functionality to shadertool


Terrain rendering:
    ☐ Find out how to do the initial adaptive meshing
    ☐ Draw the initial meshing
    ☐ use meshoptimizer to create clusters
    ☐ build the cluster hierarchy


World:
    ☐ Character navigation
        ☐ Navmeshes
    ☐ Third-person camera
    ☐ Character collision
    ☐ Animation
        ☐ Limb IK
    ☐ Lighting
    ☐ Mesh import
    ☐ Skinning & animated characters


2D rendering:
    ☐ Use case: GUI
    ☐ Use case: 3D overlay
    ☐ Use case: load/save vector drawings
    ☐ Use case: sprites
    ☐ Test harness for rendering
    ✔ Text @done (25-10-04 23:30)
    ☐ Font selection by name

Shaders:
    ✔ [shader-bridge] `struct ShaderLibrary`: represents a loaded/parsed slang source file (in shader-bridge), as a collection of entry points; used to retrieve ShaderEntryPoint objects @done (25-10-06 22:25)
    ✔ [shader-bridge] `struct ShaderEntryPoint`: represents a shader entry point, associated SPIR-V code & useful reflection data @done (25-10-06 22:25)

Direction:
    ☐ Figure out terrain representation 
    ☐ Repr: construction grids
    ☐ Repr: caves & cliffs
    ☐ Repr: artificial structures
    ☐ Repr: vegetation
    ☐ Repr: atmospheric effects / ambience
    ☐ Figure out object picking technique
    ☐ Identifying assets (e.g. some object references a font, then the name of the font is renamed; how do we identify the font?)
        ☐ Identify assets with GUIDs (within a project)
    ☐ Managing associated resources & cached resources
        ☐ E.g. if a font file is unloaded, should also free its associated cache entry in the global FontCollection
        ☐ E.g. if an image is unloaded, should also free associated GPU textures

Ideas:
    ☐ Idea: take satellite maps as input (w/ elevation) & generate stylized landscape from that, by pattern recognition
    ☐ Simulate electrical/communication networks

    ☐ ERROR_DEVICE_LOST sometimes at startup
        \Device\Video3
        Error occurred on GPUID: 700
